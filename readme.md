# Esra's Portfolio Project

## Introduction
### Aim:
To assess the evolution and impact of renewable energy sources on the total primary energy supply from 1960 to 2015.

### Scope:
--Renewable energy sources including hydro (excluding pumped storage), geothermal, solar, wind, tide, and wave.
--Bioenergy sources such as solid biofuels, biogasoline, biodiesels, other liquid biofuels, biogases, and the renewable fraction of municipal waste.
--Definition and inclusion criteria for biofuels and municipal waste in the context of renewable energy.

### Data Collection
Sources:
This dataset is collected from Kaggle
Historical energy statistics from international energy agencies, national governments, and research institutions.
Data on renewable energy production and consumption, categorized by source (hydro, wind, solar, etc.).
Information on the primary energy equivalent conversion for various renewable sources.
### Metrics:
Quantity of energy produced by each renewable source, measured in thousand tonne of oil equivalent (ktoe).
The percentage share of each renewable source in the total primary energy supply.
