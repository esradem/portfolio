# Esra's Portfolio Project

# Introduction
## Aim:
The aim of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the total wealth of nations over a specified period, with an emphasis on the dynamics of human and natural capital per capita. By integrating and visualizing data related to employment among men and women worldwide, the project seeks to uncover patterns and disparities in economic participation and wealth accumulation. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of how human and natural resources contribute to national wealth, facilitating insights into sustainable development and economic policy.
## Scope:
- The scope of the project includes the following elements:

+ 1- Data Acquisition and Preparation: Collection of relevant data on total national wealth, including specific metrics on human capital and natural capital per capita from reliable sources. This involves cleaning and preparing the data using Python and Jupyter Notebook to ensure accuracy and usability.
+ 2- Database Management: Development of a structured PostgreSQL database to efficiently manage and query large datasets, enabling robust data handling and manipulation.
+ 3- Data Analysis: Comparative analysis of employment rates between men and women globally to identify gender disparities and their correlation with national wealth metrics. The project also involves identifying the top five countries in terms of total wealth to analyze their economic structures and resource utilization.
+ 4-Visualization and Reporting: Utilization of Power BI for dynamic visualization of the data, enabling the exploration of complex relationships and trends in a user-friendly manner. This will include interactive charts and graphs that facilitate a deeper understanding of the data.
+ 5- Future Trends: The project will also explore predictive insights into future trends in national wealth and employment patterns, providing a foundation for proactive policy planning and development strategies.
